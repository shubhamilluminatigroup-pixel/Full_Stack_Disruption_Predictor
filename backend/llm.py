        "3. Group shipments with geographically near destinations for efficient multi-stop routes. "
        "4. **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT:** The sum of the 'weight' for all assigned shipments MUST be less than or equal to the truck's 'capacity_kg'. "
        "5. **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT:** The sum of the 'volume' for all assigned shipments MUST be less than or equal to the truck's 'capacity_volume'. "
